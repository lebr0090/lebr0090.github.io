Creating this prototype assigment was for sure a challenge. Through this assignment I learned how to add google docs to a website. I also learned the 
importace of good class naming through a rough spot i'd created with names that overlapped. Grids still confuse me due to the weird ways they opperate seeing as some 
of my grids worked better in a format that still makes no sense to me. 

The assets used were all photos and video game screenshots taken by myself.
